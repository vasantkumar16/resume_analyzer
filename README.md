# AI Resume Analyzer

An AI-powered web application that analyzes resumes against job descriptions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic embeddings, and Google Gemini.

The system helps applicants understand how well their resume matches a job description and helps recruiters analyze and compare multiple candidates for a job role.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI Resume Analyzer** is a Flask-based web application designed to simplify the resume screening and job-matching process.

Instead of relying only on traditional keyword matching, the application uses semantic search and RAG to understand the meaning and context of information present in resumes and job descriptions.

The application supports two types of users:

* 👤 **Applicant**
* 🧑‍💼 **Recruiter**

## 🤖 AI and RAG Features

The application uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach for resume analysis.

The basic workflow is:

```text
Resume
   ↓
Text Extraction
   ↓
Section Detection
   ↓
Semantic Chunking
   ↓
Gemini Embeddings
   ↓
ChromaDB
   ↓
Semantic Retrieval
   ↓
Relevant Resume Chunks
   ↓
Google Gemini
   ↓
Resume Analysis
```

The system retrieves the most relevant parts of the resume before sending the information to the AI model.

This allows the model to focus on the sections of the resume that are most relevant to the job description.

---

## 🧠 Why RAG?

Traditional resume screening systems often depend heavily on exact keyword matching.

For example:

**Job Description:**

```text
Experience in developing predictive models.
```

**Resume:**

```text
Developed machine learning models for classification and prediction.
```

A simple keyword-based system may not fully understand that these two statements are related.

With semantic embeddings, the application can identify content based on **meaning and context**, not just exact words.

RAG helps the system:

* Retrieve relevant resume information
* Reduce unnecessary information sent to the AI model
* Improve contextual understanding
* Provide analysis based on actual resume content
* Compare resumes and job descriptions more intelligently

# 📄 Resume Processing

The application supports the following resume formats:

```text
PDF
DOCX
```

### PDF

PDF resume text is extracted using:

```text
PyMuPDF
```

### DOCX

DOCX resume text is extracted using:

```text
python-docx
```

After extracting the text, the application processes the content and identifies different resume sections.

Common sections include:

* Summary
* Profile
* Objective
* Skills
* Technical Skills
* Experience
* Internship
* Projects
* Education
* Certifications
* Achievements

---

# ✂️ Semantic Chunking

Large resume text is divided into smaller chunks before generating embeddings.

The application uses a recursive text splitter.

Example configuration:

```python
chunk_size = 800
chunk_overlap = 100
```

### Why Chunking?

A complete resume can contain a large amount of information.

Instead of embedding the entire resume as one large piece, it is divided into smaller meaningful sections.

For example:

```text
Resume
│
├── Summary
├── Skills
├── Experience
├── Projects
├── Education
└── Certifications
```

Each chunk can then be searched independently.

### Chunk Metadata

Each chunk can contain information such as:

```text
resume_id
candidate_name
section
content
embedding
```

This allows the application to identify where retrieved information came from.

---

# 🔎 Semantic Search

After resume chunks are stored in ChromaDB, the application performs semantic retrieval.

The job description is used to identify the most relevant resume chunks.

For example:

```text
Job Requirement:
Python + Machine Learning + SQL
```

The system searches the vector database for resume sections that are semantically related to these requirements.

The retrieved chunks are then provided to the Gemini model for analysis.

---

# 🗄️ ChromaDB

The application uses **ChromaDB** as the vector database.

ChromaDB stores:

* Resume chunks
* Embeddings
* Resume IDs
* Candidate information
* Section metadata

Example:

```text
Resume Chunk
     ↓
Embedding
     ↓
ChromaDB
     ↓
Semantic Search
     ↓
Relevant Resume Content
```

The local vector database is stored in:

```text
chroma_db/
```

---

# 🤖 AI Analysis

Google Gemini is used to analyze the retrieved resume content against the job description.

The analysis can include:

* Overall match score
* Matching skills
* Missing skills
* Strengths
* Weaknesses
* Summary

Example response:

```json
{
    "overall_score": 82.5,
    "matching_skills": [
        "Python",
        "Machine Learning",
        "SQL"
    ],
    "missing_skills": [
        "Docker",
        "AWS"
    ],
    "summary": "The candidate has a strong foundation in Python and machine learning and matches several core requirements of the role.",
    "strengths": [
        "Strong Python knowledge",
        "Relevant machine learning projects"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
        "Limited cloud experience"
    ]
}
```

---

# 🔐 Authentication

The application provides separate authentication for:

```text
Applicant
Recruiter
```

User passwords are not stored directly.

Instead, passwords are securely hashed using **Werkzeug password hashing**.

The application also uses Flask sessions to maintain logged-in users.

Role-based access prevents applicants from accessing recruiter-specific functionality.

---

# ♻️ Duplicate Analysis Detection

The application uses hashing to avoid unnecessary repeated AI analysis.

Hashes can be generated for:

```text
Resume
Job Description
```

The application can check whether the same resume has already been analyzed for the same job description.

Conceptually:

```text
Resume Hash
     +
Job Description Hash
     ↓
Check Database
     ↓
Already Exists?
    /       \
  Yes        No
  ↓           ↓
Reuse       Analyze
Result      Using AI
```

This helps reduce unnecessary API requests and saves processing time.

```text
Python
Machine Learning
SQL
Flask
Git
```

A candidate's resume contains:

```text
Python
Machine Learning
SQL
Flask
```

The system may identify:

```text
Matching Skills:
Python
Machine Learning
SQL
Flask

Missing Skills:
Git
```

The final score is generated by the AI based on the retrieved resume information and job requirements.

# 🔒 Security Considerations

The project includes basic security practices such as:

* Password hashing
* Session-based authentication
* Role-based access
* Secure filename handling
* Environment variables for API keys
* Protected recruiter routes

For production deployment, additional security improvements are recommended:

* CSRF protection
* HTTPS
* Stronger session configuration
* File-size restrictions
* File-content validation
* Production database
* Rate limiting
* Secure deployment configuration

---

# ⚠️ Important Notes

### Gemini API

The application depends on Google Gemini APIs.

API model availability, quotas, rate limits, and pricing may change.

If a configured model is unavailable, the model name in the relevant service file may need to be updated.

---

### Resume Privacy

Uploaded resumes may contain personal information.

Do not upload real candidate resumes to a public GitHub repository.

The following folders should generally not contain publicly committed personal data:

```text
uploads/
chroma_db/
instance/
```

---

### `.env`

Never commit:

```text
.env
```

to GitHub.

Your API key should remain private.

---
